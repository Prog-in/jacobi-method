# HEAT / Jacobi Method

This is a parallel MPI implementation of the iterative [Jacobi method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobi_method) for solving linear systems of equations.

To compile this application you'll need an MPI distribution with ULFM support enabled.

## Building the versions

### Building the NOFT version

```sh
make jacobi_noft
```

### Building the ULFM version

```sh
make jacobi_ulfm
```

### Building the SCR version

```sh
make jacobi_scr
```

### All versions

```sh
make all
```

## Configuring a file with flags

To use flags with the application, you can use the `flags.conf` file and pass it as an argument when running the application. Here is an example of how the `flags.conf` file can be structured:

```sh
# Number of processes
-np 4
# Number of processes per row
-p 2
# Number of processes per column
-q 2
# Number of columns
-NB 1024
# Number of rows
-MB 1024
### For SCR version ###
# Debug
--debug
# Use SCR_Need_checkpoint
--use-scr-need-checkpoint
```

Use the `execute.sh` script to run the application with a flag file.

## Running the versions

After compile with `make`, Examples of how to run the different versions are below.

### Running with execute.sh

```sh
./execute.sh <binary> [-f <flag_file> | -np <NP> -p <NR> -q <NC> -NB <QC> [-MB <QR>] [--debug] [--use-scr-need-checkpoint]]
```

### Running manually

#### Running the NOFT version

```sh
mpirun -np <NP> jacobi_noft -p <NR> -q <NC> -NB <QC> [-MB <QR>]
```

#### Running the ULFM version

```sh
mpirun --with-ft=ulfm --oversubscribe -np <NP> jacobi_ulfm -p <NR> -q <NC> -NB <QC> [-MB <QR>]
```

#### Running the SCR version

```sh
mpirun -np <NP> jacobi_scr -p <NR> -q <NC> -NB <QC> [-MB <QR>] [--debug] [--use-scr-need-checkpoint]
```

Flags:

- --debug: Print debug information (not only SCR debug default messages)
- --use-scr-need-checkpoint: Use SCR_Need_checkpoint to checkpoint the application

### Arguments

- binary: Binary to be executed (jacobi_noft, jacobi_ulfm or jacobi_scr if compiled with `make`)
- flag_file: File with the flags to be used by the application
- NP: Number of processes used by the application
- NR: Number of processes per row
- NC: Number of processes per column
- QC: Number of columns
- QR: Number of rows

## Cleaning

To remove all files generated by the compilation process, run:

```sh
make clean
```

## Troubleshooting

If `make jacobi_scr` isn't working, make sure you have the `SCR_ROOT` environment variables set to the SCR installation directory.
